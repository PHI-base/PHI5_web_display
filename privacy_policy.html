<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this policy:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>'We'</strong>, <strong>'us'</strong> and <strong>'our'</strong> refers to PHI-base as an organization;</li>
    <li><strong>'You'</strong> and <strong>'your'</strong> refers to the subject of the personal information (in the case that you have provided the personal information, that subject is you).</li>
    <li><strong>'Our services'</strong> refers to the PHI-base website and the PHI-Canto curation application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>
<h3 id="phi-canto">PHI-Canto</h3>
<h4>What we collect</h4>
<p>When you use PHI-Canto to curate a publication, we collect the following personal information from you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your full name,</li>
    <li>your email address, and</li>
    <li>(optionally) your ORCID iD.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How and where the information is collected</h4>
<p>You will be asked to enter this information by filling in a form on the PHI-Canto website before starting a curation session.</p>
<h4>What we do with the information</h4>
<p>Once your curation session is submitted to PHI-base, you will be listed as the curator of the publication, meaning your full name will be displayed on the PHI-base website (usually, but not necessarily, on the page corresponding to the publication you curated).</p>
<p>We may use your email address to contact you about your curation session. For example: we may contact you with a reminder about starting or resuming your curation session, or we may ask questions about the data you have entered in a curation session.</p>
<p>We may also contact you by email to ask you to contribute an article to the PHI-base website, or to ask you to help PHI-base by volunteering as a species expert.</p>
<p>When you begin a curation session, PHI-Canto will automatically send you an email containing guidance about the curation process and a link to your curation session.</p>
<p>If you agree to opt-in to the PHI-base mailing list when starting a curation session, we may email you with announcements related to PHI-base, such as new database releases, and upcoming training sessions, conferences, or events.</p>
<h4>Why we need the information</h4>
<p>We need this personal information in order to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide proper credit to the curator for their contributions, to prevent others from falsely claiming credit for a curation;</li>
    <li>Check who to contact if we need to ask questions about any information entered in a curation session, or who to send a reminder to if a curation session has been idle for too long;</li>
    <li>Indicate to the users of PHI-base that the data is being curated by real people;</li>
    <li>Check if a publication has been curated by one of its named authors, or by someone else.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who the information is shared with</h4>
<p>Once your curation session has been submitted to PHI-base, your full name will be visible on the PHI-base website, so your full name may be shared with anyone who visits the website.</p>
<p>We do not share your email address with other organizations or people outside of PHI-base. We store email addresses only for internal use by PHI-base and PHI-Canto. Your name and email address are not included in the version of the PHI-base database that we allow users to download.</p>
<p>We may include an anonymous categorical identifier about the curator when sharing data from PHI-base with other organizations. This identifier is specifically used to indicate the role the curator has in relation to the publication: for example, if the curator is a publicly listed author of the paper, a third-party curator, or a member of the PHI-base team.</p>
<h4>How long we keep your information</h4>
<p>We will store your personal information (full name, email address, and ORCID iD) for as long as you consent to be linked with a publication. Note that you first provide your consent when starting a curation session in PHI-Canto.</p>
<p>If you no longer want to be involved with the curation of a publication, you can contact us to tell us that you no longer consent, and we will stop storing your personal information (see the section on <a href="#your-data-protection-rights">Your data protection rights</a> for more details). If you have already submitted your curation session, the publication you curated will remain on PHI-base, but your name will be replaced with an anonymous identifier, such as 'community curator'.</p>

<h3 id="phi-base">PHI-base</h3>
<p>When you download a copy of the PHI-base database from the PHI-base website, we collect the following personal information from you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your name,</li>
    <li>the name and sector of the organization where you work, and</li>
    <li>your organizational email address.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How and where the information is collected</h4>
<p>You will be asked to enter this information by filling in a form on the PHI-base website before downloading a copy of the PHI-base database.</p>
<h4>What we do with the information</h4>
<p>We use your personal information to generate an anonymized count of the number of unique users who have downloaded the PHI-base database. We also use your personal information to group this anonymized data by the organization that the users belonged to. This allows us to see, for example, how often PHI-base is being used by research organizations, compared to commercial organizations.</p>
<h4>Why we need the information</h4>
<p>We need your personal information to ensure that we can accurately count unique downloads of the PHI-base database, so we do not classify repeated downloads by the same person as downloads by a new person.</p>
<p>We need to count and categorize the downloads of PHI-base so that we can demonstrate to our funders and other interested groups that PHI-base is useful to the scientific community.</p>
<h4>Who the information is shared with</h4>
<p>We do not share your personal information with other organizations or people outside of PHI-base. In order to prove that PHI-base is useful to the scientific community, we may be required to share anonymous aggregated data with our funders, such as: the total number of visitors to the PHI-base website, the number of downloads of PHI-base, and the countries that are using PHI-base.</p>
<h4>How long we keep your information</h4>
<p>We will store your personal information for a maximum of three years, or until the end of the grant cycle for the PHI-base project (whichever occurs first).</p>
